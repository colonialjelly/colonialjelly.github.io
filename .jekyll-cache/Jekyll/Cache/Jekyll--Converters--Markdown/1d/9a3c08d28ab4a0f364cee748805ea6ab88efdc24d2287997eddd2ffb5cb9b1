I"<p>I’m currently a machine learning engineer at Route where I work on fraud detection. I previously spent time at Proofpoint working on phishing detection systems. Even before that I was a data scientist at Pulsar AI, where I led the data science efforts behind the biggest nation-wide secret santa ever.</p>

<p>I’m a strong believer in writing as a tool for learning. I use this blog as a space for me explore ideas and learn new things. If anyone either learns anything from here or enjoys reading a post, that’s a bonus.</p>
