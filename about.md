Hey there :wave:, I'm Giorgi (or Gio if you're in a hurry). I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Spotify](https://spotify.com/), where I work on music infringement detection. Previously, I was an ML Scientist at [SiriusXM/Pandora](https://www.siriusxm.com/pandora), where I worked on music catalog matching and search. Before that, I had a couple of positions where I worked on [recommender systems in e-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14982) as a Machine Learning Scientist at [Overstock](https://www.overstock.com/) and a Machine Learning Engineer at [Route](https://route.com/). 

My journey started with internships at [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com), where I focused on [phishing detection solutions using machine learning](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200314122A1/en). I also had a fun stint at Pulsar AI  ([acquired by Impel](https://impel.io/newsroom/impel-acquires-pulsar-ai/)), where I led the creation of the [first ever data-driven Secret Santa](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/techreports/2018/pdf/UUCS-18-004.pdf).

I received a joint BS/MS from University of Utah in Computer Science. During my time there, I was lucky enough to do research at the [Utah NLP lab](http://nlp.cs.utah.edu/) under the guidance of [Vivek Srikumar](https://svivek.com/), where I worked on [analyzing robustness of neural NLP models towards invalid inputs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03453.pdf) and speeding up inference of large NLP models using cascading.
